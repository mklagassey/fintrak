# FinTrak: A Modern Financial Tracker

### A Professional-Grade Portfolio Project for Back-End Java Developers

This repository contains the source code for **FinTrak**, a full-stack application designed to track and manage personal finances. Unlike a simple to-do list, this project is a strategic professional portfolio piece that demonstrates proficiency in modern software architecture, security, and advanced problem-solving.

## üåü What Problem Does It Solve?

Many personal finance applications are either monolithic and complex or too simplistic to be useful. FinTrak addresses this by providing a clean, microservices-based platform for managing personal finances. It allows users to manually track income, expenses, and budgets, and provides a consolidated dashboard for financial oversight.

The project's primary purpose is to serve as a **compelling and unique portfolio item**. It demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complex, enterprise-grade application from the ground up, with a strong emphasis on **scalability**, **security**, and **data integrity**.

## üöÄ Key Features (MVP)

* **Secure User Authentication**: A robust login and registration system using Spring Security and stateless JWT authentication.
* **Manual Transaction & Budget Entry**: Allows users to manually record income and expenses and set budgets for a clear view of their spending habits.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a consolidated view of a user's financial data with basic analytics and visualizations.
* **Third-Party API Integration**: A dedicated microservice integrates with the **Alpha Vantage API** for looking up real-time stock and cryptocurrency data.

## üí° Architectural Decisions

FinTrak is built on a **microservices architecture** to showcase an understanding of modern, distributed systems. This approach provides several key benefits:

* **Modularity**: Each service (User, Finance, Market Data) is independent, making the system easier to develop, test, and maintain.
* **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on load.
* **Resilience**: The failure of one service does not bring down the entire system.

A key architectural choice was the implementation of a **caching layer** within the Market Data Service. This was a strategic solution to overcome the **25-request-per-day rate limit** of the Alpha Vantage free API. By caching results, the application provides a seamless user experience while intelligently managing API calls, demonstrating an understanding of real-world constraints and proactive problem-solving.
